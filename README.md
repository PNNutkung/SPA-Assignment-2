# Design Patterns with Java Spring
Software Patterns and Architecture 2nd assignment on implementing a Spring Enterprise Design Pattern project
## Getting Started
Clone this project to your local machine.
### Prerequisites

[Spring Tool Suuuuuuuuuuuuite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) - Spring variant of Eclipse
Note: Of course, you can use your editor of choice i.e, IntelliJ, but you will have to manually setup a lot of stuffs and I won't cover that. Just use this one if you are lazy like me.

[Apache Tomcat 8.0.43](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) - Java Servlet


### Installing

Extract both Spring tool suite and Apache Tomcat to anywhere you wish.
Launch the suite and navigate to this project and wait for Maven to update dependencies.
Try running the project and it should prompt you to create a new server.
Detailed Installation of Apache Tomcat refers to this [How to setup tomcat with Eclipse](http://websystique.com/misc/how-to-setup-tomcat-with-eclipse/)
Home page of project should pop up once the server is ready.
